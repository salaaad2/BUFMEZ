# project BUFMEZ (aka threshold)

This is a small work in progress game. This was made using [raylib](http://raylib.com)

As this is a way for me to have fun, I decided to recreate something similar to SUPERHOT, but in two dimensions.

Most of the prototype features are done, but it is currenty very barebones.

Feel free to fork & add features.

## Build

- make sure you have rayib installed, then run :

``` sh
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ..
./space
```


## Work In progress 

- Visual improvements

- Better Level System

## Future work

- Music

- Optimizations on vectors (too many function calls)
